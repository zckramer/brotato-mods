# DamageMeter for Brotato

A comprehensive damage tracking mod for Brotato that displays real-time damage statistics for each player, including total damage dealt and the top damage sources (weapons/items).

## Features

- **Total Damage Display**: Shows each player's total damage as a progress bar, with percentage relative to the highest damage dealer
- **Top Damage Sources**: Displays the top 6 damage sources (weapons, items, abilities) with their individual damage values
- **Item Grouping**: Automatically groups identical items (e.g., multiple turrets) and shows the count
- **Smart Tracking**: Tracks damage from:
  - All weapons
  - Damage-dealing items
  - Spawned entities (turrets from Wrench, landmines from Screwdriver, turrets from Pocket Factory)
  - Character abilities
- **Visual Indicators**: 
  - Item rarity colors (Common, Uncommon, Rare, Legendary)
  - Cursed item markers (purple flames)
  - Rounded icon backgrounds
- **Performance Optimized**: Intelligent caching system for smooth gameplay

## Installation

Install via Steam Workshop or download from the repository.

**Optional:**
- **ModOptions** (Oudstand-ModOptions) - Enables in-game configuration UI
- Without ModOptions, the mod uses default settings and works perfectly fine

## Configuration

**With ModOptions (Optional):**

If you have ModOptions installed, configure all settings in-game via **Options → Mods → DamageMeter**:
1. Go to **Options → Mods → DamageMeter**
2. Adjust settings with sliders and toggles
3. Changes are saved automatically and persist across game restarts
4. Changes apply instantly without needing to restart

**Available Settings:**
- **OPACITY** (0.3-1.0): Transparency of all UI elements (default: 1.0)
- **NUMBER_OF_SOURCES** (1-25): Number of top damage sources to display (default: 6)
- **SHOW_ITEM_COUNT**: Show count for grouped items (default: true)
- **SHOW_DPS**: Show damage per second (default: false)
- **SHOW_PERCENTAGE**: Show percentage values relative to top player (default: true)
- **HIDE_DAMAGE_BAR_SOLO**: Hide damage bar when playing solo (default: false)

**Without ModOptions:**

The mod works perfectly with default settings shown above. No configuration needed!

## How It Works

### Damage Tracking
- **Weapons**: Tracked via `dmg_dealt_last_wave` property
- **Items**: Tracked via `RunData.tracked_item_effects` for items with `DAMAGE_DEALT` tracking
- **Spawned Entities**: Automatically detects and tracks damage from:
  - Engineering turrets (Wrench weapon)
  - Landmines (Screwdriver weapon)
  - Pocket Factory turrets

### Grouping System
Items are grouped by:
- Item ID
- Tier (rarity)
- Cursed status

This means 5 common turrets are grouped together, but a cursed turret appears separately.

### Performance
- **Source Caching**: The mod caches which items/weapons a player has and only recalculates damage values
- **Selective Updates**: UI elements only update when their values change
- **Optimized Arrays**: Uses PoolArrays for better performance

### Display Logic
- Progress bars are relative to the highest damage dealer (100%)
- When Player 1 has 100 damage and Player 2 has 80 damage:
  - Player 1: 100% progress bar
  - Player 2: 80% progress bar
- Bars update dynamically as damage changes

## Dependencies

- **ModOptions** (Oudstand-ModOptions): Optional - Enables in-game configuration UI
  - Without it, the mod uses default values and works fine
  - Recommended for users who want to customize settings
  - Available in this repository

## Compatibility

- **Mod Loader Version**: 6.2.0+
- **Game Version**: 1.1.12.0
- **Multiplayer**: Supports up to 4 players

## Known Issues

- Some modded items may not be tracked if they don't use standard damage tracking
